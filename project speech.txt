this Project is purely based on the java. I developed that project build on Eclipse IDE . this IDE to help me to manage my project directory and easy to use. In this Project I used Core Java Concept Such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism , and Collection. and so many switch cases for Menu also I used Exception handling Concept that was handle the Exception at the time of input. if user give the input as number that is ok but the user give the input as character then at the time of run time compiler gives the InputMisMatch Exception this problem i will handle using try catch. And One more feature i add in my project that was festival offer If the user choose the option as 1 for festival then system check today date is equal to the festival date if it is not then user dont get any festival offer if date is match to the festival date the then user get festival offer. thats all About My Project
